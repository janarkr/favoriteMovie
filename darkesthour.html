        <h1> Darkest Hour (2017) </h1>
       
       <p> This movie covers the experience of Winston Churchill, British PM belonging to the World War 2 period. The movie brillantly shows how Mr Churchill overcame Parlimentary opposition and stuck to his principles and guts. I loved the movie for the exciting portrayal of one of the most consequential leaders in history</p>

      <h2>Storyline</h2>

      <p>In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party colleagues he wants Lord Halifax as his successor, but Halifax does not feel the time is right. Chamberlain is forced to choose the only man whom the opposition parties will accept: Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, who correctly predicted the danger from Adolf Hitler before the war.</p>

      <p>Under heavy pressure, Churchill agrees to consider a negotiated peace but cannot dictate a letter requesting talks. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King explains that he has come to like Churchill and encourages him to continue the war. Still uncertain, Churchill impulsively rides the London Underground (for the first time in his life) and asks startled passengers their opinion: the civilians all want to continue to fight. Churchill meets with the Outer Cabinet and other Members of Parliament and receives their support. The evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo, is successful.</P>
